Subject: ProRes Tools – Reliability & Error Handling Upgrades

Hi Chen,

Quick update on ProRes Tools: I’ve completed a major round of improvements to make our video processing more robust and transparent:

- **Failed conversions** now go to a dedicated _FAILED folder for easy review.
- **Conversion reports**: You can generate a PDF log after each run, showing which files succeeded, failed, or had alpha channels, plus error messages and timestamps.
- **Stronger error handling**: Every file is validated before and after conversion, timeouts are enforced, errors are clearly categorized and logged, and the tool retries transient failures automatically.
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time stats and estimated time remaining are shown during batch jobs.
- **File integrity**: SHA256 checksums are logged for every conversion.

Let me know if you want a demo or more details!

Best,
