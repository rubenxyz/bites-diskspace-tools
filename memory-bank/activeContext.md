# Active Context

The project has an existing codebase with a clear structure. The main entry point is `prores_tools/cli.py`, which uses the `typer` library to create a command-line interface. The core logic is organized into separate modules for converting, cleaning, reporting, and utility functions. The immediate focus is on understanding this existing structure to prepare for future development.
